- OUTPUT: for pin that output signal

## GPIO

```c
digitalRead(pin);
digitalWrite(pin, HIGH/LOW);
```

- in function digitalRead():
  - For 5V power supply, if the voltage is >3.0V return HIGH;
  - For 3.3V power supply, if the voltage is >2.0V return HIGH;
- in function digitalRead():
  - ouput 5V if HIGH in 5V power supply
  - ouput 3.3V if HIGH in 3.3V power supply
